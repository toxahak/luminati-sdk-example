# luminati-sdk-example

This repo contains a sample Android app, showcasing usage of [Luminati SDK](http://luminati.io/sdk?affiliate=ref_sdk_antonp&cam=L_lior) as an option for monetization of your awesome application!

## Get started

First, you will need to sign up to Luminati SDK [here](http://luminati.io/sdk?affiliate=ref_sdk_antonp&cam=L_lior) and download SDK library, which is called `topvpn_vpn_api.aar`, and place it in the root of `libs` folder.

Second, run this example! It's that simple :)

## Integration guide

Coming soon... Get a cup of tea and we'll post it somewhere online meanwhile :)
